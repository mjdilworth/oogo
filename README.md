##introduction##
I will use this to refresh and deepen my understanding of go

i plan to cover topics such as:
- modules
- packages
- encapsulation
- polymorphism
- inheritance
- unit testing
- interfaces
- channels
- multi-threading
- build pipelines
- disrtoless containers
- functions as a service

##Modules##
- create source directory
- create go.mod

##Structure##
i think i will use this as a structure
- create main
- create the app structure
- have a package for exposing a health enpoint - maybe turn this into a module becaus eit can be kind of reusable
